Contributing
------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, but do not mess with the VERSION. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump the version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore it when I pull.
* Send me a pull request.
